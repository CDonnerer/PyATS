# PyATS

PyATS: Calculate ATS cross-sections based on crystal symmetries

## Feature list ##

Compute REXS cross-sections:

* ATS tensor from symmetries
* Resonant magnetic x-ray scattering tensor (using spherical approximation)
* Non-resonant magnetic x-ray scattering tensor
* Absorption corrections for different surface

Computer non-resonant XRD:

* Single crystal diffraction intensities
* Powder patterns
