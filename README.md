# PyATS
PyATS: Calculate ATS cross-sections based on crystal symmetries

## Features ##

Compute REXS cross-sections:

* ATS tensor from symmetries
* Resonant magnetic x-ray scattering tensor (using spherical approximation)
* Non-resonant magnetic x-ray scattering tensor
* Crystal orientation for arbitrary scattering vector and azimuth
* Azimuthal scans, etc.

Computer non-resonant XRD:

* Single crystal diffraction
* Simulate powder pattern
